   - `serverURL` is the link of the server, which you just got.

   ```html {3-7,12-18}:line-numbers
   <head>
     <!-- ... -->
     <script src="https://unpkg.com/@waline/client@v2/dist/waline.js"></script>
     <link
       rel="stylesheet"
       href="https://unpkg.com/@waline/client@v2/dist/waline.css"
     />
